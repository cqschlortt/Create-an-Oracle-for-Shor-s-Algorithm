# Create-an-Oracle-for-Shor-s-Algorithm
This is python Qiskit code for the oracle for Shor's algortihm which utilizes the methods from "Circuit for Shor's algorithm using  2n+3  qubits, S. Beauregard, arXiv:quant-ph/0205095."  As described in the paper, the final oracle uses several different gates including a adder gate, which uses Draper's algorithm to add two numbers represented in binary and stored in quantum registers, a gate which adds mod N, which uses the previously described adder gate to implement, a gate which controlled multiplies mod N, implemented using controlled versions of the adder gate mod N and its inverse, and finally the oracle, which uses the multiplication gate, its inverse and a SWAP gate (to ensure the final value is in the correct register). 

Throughout this code, a_val is a, N_val is N, and n is the number of bits needed to represent N in binary.

The oracle takes in a_val, N_val, and n, a control qubit c of size 1 and an n length register y (holding the binary number y), and does nothing if c = 0 and changes the register y to hold ay mod N in binary if c = 1. In order to use this oracle, you must first initialize a circuit with one quantum register of size n called 'a' which contains the binary representation of a_val, one quantum register of size n called 'N' which contains the binary representation of N, one quantum register of size n called 'y' which contains the binary representation of y, one quantum register of size one called 'c' which acts as the control for the oracle, one quantum register of size n called 'z' which contains the output, and one ancilla register of size one called 'd' to asssist with computations.  Then the oracle can be appended to the circuit as a gate, with c as the control bit.
